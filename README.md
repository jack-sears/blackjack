# Blackjack Trainer Project  
### By Jack Sears - 2025

Welcome to my BlackJack Trainer! This program simulates a Blackjack game and provides feedback on optimal strategies.
Optimal strategies can be found under the PDF Guide section listed below.

You can download the program [here](). The program currently just runs in the terminal.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the program using `python blackjack.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to play the game!

## Future Functionality
- **Betting**: Add a system where users start with a set amount of money and can place bets on each hand. The amount updates based on wins/losses.
- **AI Training**: Introduce an AI component that tracks the user's move history and prioritizes weaker hands for practice.
- **Front-End**: Build a graphical user interface (GUI) to replace the terminal-based gameplay for a more engaging experience.
